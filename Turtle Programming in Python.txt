Turtle Programming in Python

“Turtle” is a Python feature like a drawing board, 
which lets us command a turtle to draw all over it! 
We can use functions like turtle.forward(…) and turtle.right(…) 
which can move the turtle around.

Turtle can draw intricate shapes using programs that repeat simple moves.
